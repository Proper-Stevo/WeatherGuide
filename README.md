## Description
One of the most important things you can do as a developer is understand the function of API's and how to utlizes them to the most you can. In this project picking form certain API calls and selecting the right information was crucial. Whenever youre working in long array's of imformation its important to call the right info. Here was had to get temperature, UV index, humidity and name's for today and the next 5 days and be able to display them when you call them. This was a great project to really use almost everything we've learned so far in this
